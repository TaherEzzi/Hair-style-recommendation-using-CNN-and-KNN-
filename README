Setup Instructions
Before running the code, please ensure the required dependencies are installed.

You will need to generate the cache files for men's and women's hairstyles, as the model can be trained using parameters defined in the provided CSV file.

Note: Cache files (.npz) are not included in this repository because they depend on individual preprocessing preferences and requirements.

Please create your own preprocessing script tailored to your use case, and generate the necessary .npz files accordingly.
